## Run Casino

* Use `script/casino-run.py`

1. Generate patch candidates

    ```
    python3 script/casino-run.py gen
    ```

    If finished, run

    ```
    python3 script/casino-run.py repair
    ```

2. Run casino

    ```
    python3 script/casino-run.py casino <id>
    ```

    Output will be in `out-<id>` directory.


# Introduction
Automated Program Repair (APR) helps improve the efficiency of software development and maintenance. Recent APR techniques use deep learning, particularly the encoder-decoder architecture, to generate patches. Though existing DL-based APR approaches have proposed different encoder architectures, the decoder remains to be the standard one, which generates a sequence of tokens one by one to replace the faulty statement. This decoder has multiple limitations: 1) allowing to generate syntactically incorrect programs, 2) inefficiently representing small edits, and 3) not being able to generate project-specific identifiers.

In this paper, we propose Recoder, a syntax-guided edit decoder with placeholder generation. Recoder is novel in multiple aspects: 1) Recoder generates edits rather than modified code, allowing efficient representation of small edits; 2) Recoder is syntax-guided, with the novel provider/decider architecture to ensure the syntactic correctness of the patched program and accurate generation; 3) Recoder generates placeholders that could be instantiated as project-specific identifiers later.

We conduct experiments to evaluate Recoder on 395 bugs from Defects4J v1.2 and 420 additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0. Our results show that Recoder repairs 53 bugs on Defects4J v1.2, which achieves 26.2% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach for single-hunk bugs (TBar). Importantly, to our knowledge, Recoder is the first DL-based APR approach that has outperformed the traditional APR approaches on this dataset. Furthermore, Recoder also repairs 19 bugs on the additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0, which is 137.5% more than TBar (8 bugs) and 850% more than SimFix (2 bugs). This result suggests that Recoder has better generalizability than existing APR approaches.

## To Run Recoder via Docker

* To run the docker, you need first install docker in your machine.
    ```
    sudo apt install docker
    ```
* To use GPUs, you need to install CUDA v10.2 in your machine.
    1. Download the corresponding CUDA file in [Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive).
    2. Install CUDA
    ```
    bash cuda.sh(name of the CUDA file)
    ```
* To use GPUs in docker, you also need to install nvidia-docker.(We take Ubuntu as example, more details can be found in [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker))
    ```
    # Add the package repositories
    distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
    curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
    curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    sudo apt-get install nvidia-container-runtime
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```
* Pull the docker
    We provider two  docker files to run Recoder.
    * To use Recoder to repair defects with pre-trained model
        ```
        sudo docker pull zqh111/recoder:interface 
        ```
    * To train Recoder
        ```
        sudo docker pull zqh111/recoder:training 
        ```
* Start the docker
    * Inference  
    ```
    docker run -it --gpus all --shm-size="1g" zqh111/recoder:interface /bin/bash
    cd /root/Repair/
    ```
    * Training
    ```
    docker run -it --gpus all --shm-size="1g" zqh111/recoder:training /bin/bash
    cd /root/Repair/
    ```
## Training Set
The data is included in the docker. 

The raw data https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ECNX98qj9FMdRT2MXOUY6aQ6-sNT0b_a?usp=sharing .

## Train a New Model
```python
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python3 run.py train
```
The saved model is ```checkpointSearch/best_model.ckpt```.

After our model was trained, we can 

## Generate Patches for Defects4J v1.2 with Ochiai by
```python
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 testDefect4j.py bugid
```

The generated patches are in folder ```patch/``` in json.

## Generate Patches for Defects4J v2.0 by
```python
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 testDefect4jv21.py bugid
```

The generated patches are in folder ```patch/``` in json.

We further test the generated patches based on the test cases by

## Validate Patches
```python
python3 repair.py bugid
```

The results are in folder ```patches/``` in json.

## Generate Patches for Quixbugs
Replace 'testDefect4j.py' with 'testQuixbug.py' and modify the corresponding file path, then run 
```python
python3 testQuixbug.py
```

## Validate Patches Parallelly
```python
python3 totalrepair.py
```
 you need to change the corresponding bug IDs in this file.
